HOUSTON, Monday, July 21—New hires landed and walked on the moon.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[715, 700, 911, 750]]<|/det|>
Two Americans, astronauts of Apollo 11, steered their Eagle-shaped lunar module safely and smoothly to the lunar landing yesterday at 4:17:40 P.M., Eastern day-light time.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[715, 750, 911, 780]]<|/det|>
Neil A. Armstrong, the 38-year-old civilian commander, radioed to earth and the landing team here.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[715, 780, 911, 830]]<|/det|>
"Boom, Truesquily! Base here. The Eagle has landed," the first man to reach the moon—Neil Armstrong and his engineer, Capt. Charles E. Alder, of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the space agency's rocket and space program manager.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[715, 830, 911, 880]]<|/det|>
About six and a half hours later, Mr. Armstrong opened the landing craft's hatch, stepped slowly down the ladder and descended as he pointed his first landing footguard on the lunar crater.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[715, 880, 911, 920]]<|/det|>
"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[715, 920, 911, 960]]<|/det|>
His first step on the moon came on 10:56:29 P.M., as a television camera recorded the craft's transmitted his every word to an aerial and excited audiences of hundreds of millions of people on earth.
