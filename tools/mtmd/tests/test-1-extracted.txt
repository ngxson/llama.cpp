Voice From Moon:
'Eagle Has Landed'

A Powder Surface
Is Closely Explored

NOVEMBER, Monday, July 21—New York Herald and
wished on the moon.

Two American astronauts of Apollo 11, steered their
frigate Eagle toward the moon's surface and smoothly to
the lunar landing yesterday at 4:17:40 P.M., Eastern day-
light time.

Neil A. Armstrong, the 38-year-old civilian commander,
landed on the soft sand of the moon's surface here.

"Beautiful, Triumph!" he said. "The Eagle has landed."

The first man to reach the moon—Neil Armstrong and
his co-pilot, Charles E. "Pete" Conrad, 26, of the Pentagon,
brought their ship to rest on a level, rock-strewn plain near
the moon's surface. The two men and two of the three
astronauts on board, Armstrong, Conrad and Edwin E.
Aldrin, 38, of Houston, stepped slowly down the ladder
and descended as he pointed his first full-flaming footpad
at the lunar crater.

"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for
mankind."

His first step on the moon came at 10:56:20 P.M., as
a television camera rolled the earth's thousandth line every
second to an aerial and studied audiences of hundreds of
millions of people on earth.
